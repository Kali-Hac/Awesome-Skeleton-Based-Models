## Acknowledge

Thanks for the awesome repositories from [Niais](https://github.com/niais/Awesome-Skeleton-based-Action-Recognition), [Wangzheallen](https://github.com/wangzheallen/awesome-human-pose-estimation), [wangyongjie-ntu](https://github.com/wangyongjie-ntu/Awesome-explainable-AI), etc. 

I will appreacite much if you help re-organize and refine current taxonomy (e.g., add more papers related to skeletons) and archive uncategoried papers or anything to enrich this repository. 

If you have any problems, suggestions or improvements, please feel free to contact me (haocong001@ntu.edu.sg). Welcome to discuss together.
